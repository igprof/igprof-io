IgProf.io
---------

A multi profile web GUI for IgProf.


Quick start
-----------

The easiest way to start / deploy it is to use [docker](https://docker.io).

Assuming you have your sqlite profiles in `$PWD/data` you can start
the GUI in development mode by doing.

    ./run.sh

and then have your browser point to port 8888 of the machine where the
container is running.
